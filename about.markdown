Hi, I'm Seth! I'm an easy-going midwesterner who loves the outdoors and cooking with cast iron. Since I was a teenager I've been interested in technology and web development, and somewhere along the line I became a musician as well. You'll likely find me playing small shows in central Iowa or photographing your friend's weddings. I love open source code and projects that are aimed at protecting users online and that encourage digital autonomy.

Check out my [github](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}) or follow me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/{{ site.instagram_username }}).

I can't wait to be friends!
