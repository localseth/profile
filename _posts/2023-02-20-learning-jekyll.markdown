I'm getting ready to publish this website today and I just wanted to share some of my process for building this site.

Most of what I've learned so far has been javascript and javascript frameworks such as [React](https://reactjs.org). After looking at other options for publishing a site I decided to go with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because of convenient blog format, RSS feeds, and simple deployment via [GitHub](https://www.github.com). Jekyll is written in Ruby and I had never used Ruby before, but it was pretty easy to pick up the syntax from the pre-existing code examples. What I really like about programming websites is how simple it is to set up an organized data structure and use basic programming tools (such as for loops) to display lots of information that will change over time.

I implemented a custom CSS file for this website to over-ride some of the default styles of the built-in theme. I welcome and feedback on styling and coding practices as I'm still fairly new.

Anyway, that's it for now. Cheers!
